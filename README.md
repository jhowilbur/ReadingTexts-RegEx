## This application came about with the purpose of making a program that reads a very large text file and that it takes the 50 thousand most frequent phrases. The file format is lines with up to 50 phrases divided by pipe (“|”).

- The steps for the program to execute are as follows:
- read text file.
- each line of the file has n words.
- each text on the line is separated by a pipe (“|”).
- each line is separated by a line break.
- check with Map and HashMap what the word is and how many times the word repeats.

##### any file in txt format can be loaded into the code, for this example to be as didactic as possible, a file called texts.txt was created and stored at the root of the project.

##### the example file contains 10 words "PREPARADO", 5 words "SONHO CONQUISTADO", 4 words "JAVA" and a hidden bonus word (can you find it?).

##### The twenty words were divided into five lines, each line containing four of those words informed, distributed at random and separated by pipe (“|”).

###### when testing the code the output output will be:
